  <h2>Historical Places</h2>
  <h3>Anıtkabir – Mausoleum of Atatürk</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="image/anıtkabir.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Anıtkabir view" width="500" height="377"></p>
  <p>The magnitude of Atatürk’s legacy is undeniable when you first witness his lavish memorial. It’s hard to not be impressed by its sheer size and grandeur – it’s simple, yet powerful. It reminded me of Ho Chi Minh’s Mausoleum in Hanoi, Vietnam and sends a similar message to its visitors. This extravagant tomb and memorial is particularly important to the city of Ankara because it was Atatürk, the revolutionary founder and first president of the new Republic of Turkey, who designated Ankara as the country’s new capital city. On the 69th anniversary of his death, over 550,000 people visited the mausoleum to pay respect to the Father of Modern Turkey. Think about that for a moment!</p>
  <h3>Ankara Citadel</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="image/kale.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Kale view" width="500" height="377"></p>
  <p>For fantastic city views of Ankara, head to the Ankara Citadel, situated in the Ulus Bentderesi District in the Old Quarters. Ankara has many interesting archaeological sites scattered throughout the city, however only a few structures surrounding the citadel have survived its appetite for development and modernization. The citadel surrounds Old Ankara and is free to enter and explore. But be forewarned, there are no barriers or handrails to protect clumsy walkers or those with a paralyzing fear of heights – and it’s a long way down.</p></br></br>
  <h3>The Museum of Anatolian Civilization</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="image/museum.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Museum view" width="500" height="377"></p>
  <p>Arguably the most important museum in central Anatolia, the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations contains priceless artifacts from the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras as well as the Hatti, Hittite, Phrygian, Urartu and Roman civilizations. Some people travel all the way to Ankara just to visit this museum and witness its fine collection. The museum is located within two beautifully restored Ottoman buildings on the south side of Ankara Castle, so visitors can easily check out the Ankara Citadel, Ankara Castle, Old Quarters and Museum of Anatolian Civilizations all in one visit.</p>
